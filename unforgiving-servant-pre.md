One time Peter asked Jesus, “If my brother or sister does something bad, or wrong, or if they’re mean to me, how many times do I have to forgive them? When is it enough? How about seven times?” What do you think Jesus said? Here's what it says in the Bible:  

“I tell you, not as many as seven,” Jesus replied, “but seventy times seven.” That means, you always have to forgive them. Then he told him a story.  

Once there was a king, with many servants. One servant owed the king a lot of money. It was so much money, he could never pay it! Even if he asked everyone he knew, and added all the money together, he couldn’t pay it. He would need this much (3.5 m^3, gesture to show the size) of 100% pure gold. It was impossible to repay. But he put his face all the way on the ground and begged the king, “Please wait and I’ll give you back all the money!!”

The king said something surprising. He said, “I’ll forgive you. You don’t have to pay me anything anymore.” What do you think about that? (It’s amazing, etc.) Do you think that king was kind? (Yes)

Then the servant went to another servant who owed him money. It wasn’t a small amount, but wayyyyy less than what the servant had owed the king. What do you think he did?

He grabbed him and was really rough and said “Pay what you owe!!!”

So the other servant put his face all the way on the ground and begged him, “Please wait and I’ll give you back all the money!” So what do you think happened?

He threw him in prison!! What do you think about that?

So then other servants were really upset and they told the king about it. So the king called the first servant back, the one who he had forgiven, and he said, “You are really bad! You begged me, so I forgave you the huge amount of money. I was kind to you right? You’re both servants; you should have been kind to him too!” Then the king sent the bad servant to jail.

All of us do wrong things called sin. Sometimes when we should be kind, we are mean instead. We should help our brothers or sisters or mom or dad or teachers or classmates. But sometimes we get mad and hurt them on purpose. That’s a sin against God too. No matter what we do, we can’t take back the wrong things we do. So God sent Jesus. He died because of people’s sins. Then God raised him from the dead so he’s alive now! If we trust in Jesus, God forgives us of all our sins. And we can live with God forever! That’s amazing right? And Jesus said if God forgives us of all our sins, we should always forgive other people too when they hurt us.

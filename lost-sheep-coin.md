# Bible Lesson

## Jesus tells a parable: 
One day a long time ago when Jesus was on earth he would tell people about God and the way that God wants us to live.  
Jesus told people a parable which is like a story so they could understand God better.  
Jesus told people to think about a shepherd. Can you think about a shepherd?  
A shepherd is someone who takes care of sheep. They make sure that the sheep have food, water and a place to rest. A shepherd keeps his sheep safe.  
A shepherd will count the sheep to make sure all the sheep are there every day.  
A shepherd does not want any of his sheep to get lost.  
## The lost sheep: 
Jesus tells a story about a shepherd who had one hundred sheep and one of them was lost. So now he only has ninety-nine sheep.  
The shepherd did not say “Well, that is ok. I have lots of sheep!”  
Instead he went out and looked all over for it.   
The shepherd will keep looking for the sheep until he finds it.  
How do you think the shepherd feels right now?  
When he finds it he carries it back to his friends and says, “I found my lost sheep! Come have a party with me because I thought I had lost this sheep but now I have found it!” 
## The Gospel: 
Jesus said that people are like sheep and God is like the shepherd.  
God loves every person just like this shepherd loves his sheep.  
Our sin makes us far from God like this sheep going away from the shepherd.  
But God does not want us to be far away.  
God loves us so much he wants us to be near him!  
Just like the shepherd in the story went to look for and rescue the lost sheep, God also rescues us!  
He sent his son Jesus into the world to die on the cross for our sins.  
It’s like we were lost and far away from God, but when we believe in Jesus God rescues us and finds us!  
And when we believe, God is so happy! God wants everyone in the whole world to believe in Jesus!  

# Bible Lesson

## Jesus tells a parable: 
One day Jesus was telling people some parables.  
A parable is a story that Jesus tells to help us understand God and his ways better.  
Jesus said to think about a lady who had ten coins. Can you hold up ten fingers?  
This lady really likes her coins. She counts them to make sure that she has them all and that none were lost. (count the ten coins from the previous activity.)  
But one day she lost one of her coins. How do you think she felt? What do you think she did?  
That's right! She would go and look for it!  
She looks all over her house. She looked everywhere for her coin. She swept her whole house and looked and looked for it.  
She did not stop looking for it until she found it.  
When she found her coin she called her friends and said, “I found my lost coin! Come have a party with me because I thought I had lost this coin but now I have found it!”  
## The Gospel:  
At the end of this story Jesus said that God loves every person just  like the lady loved her coins. God loves people even more than this lady loved her coins.  
We are all lost. Not because we don’t know where we are but because of our sin.  
Our sin keeps us away from God.  
God wants us to be near him because he loves us.  
So he made a way for us to be near him by sending Jesus to take away our sin. Jesus died and rose again so that anyone who believes can be with God forever.  
Each of us has to decide if we want to believe in Jesus and follow God.  
Whenever a person chooses to do this, God celebrates!

- Say: I have lost some of my sheep, can you help me find them?  
Let the children look around and find the lost sheep.  
After the children find the sheep you can repeat this activity by asking the kids to close their eyes while you hide the sheep in different places.  
- Say: There was a lost sheep in our lesson today. God is like the shepherd in the story and we are like the lost sheep. And we can be like the friends and neighbors who celebrate too.  

# Activity #3b: Coin Search! 

Hide ten coins around the room.  
- Say: I have lost some coins. Can you help me find them?

# Activity #4a: Act out the story!

How does the shepherd feel?

Repeat this so that other children can have a turn being different parts of the story. 

# Activity #4b: Group Story Retell

As a group, lead the children in acting out the lesson together.  
First count the coins (use coins from previous activity) but discover you only have nine coins!

Pretend to search and sweep the floor. Look everywhere.  
Find the coin and celebrate!  
Call all your friends to celebrate!

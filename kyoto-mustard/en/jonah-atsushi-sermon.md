Good morning everyone. Once again welcome. Associate pastor Atsushi. I have privilege to translate today. こちらこそ, thanks for having me.

Today we begin sermon series in Jonah. By the way, we announced this last week but there's a journal you can use for this series. In it there's a section for sermon notes. And so when you're participating on Sundays, as you listen to the sermon please use that to take notes.

So let's go ahead and look at Jonah. Today I first want to talk about what kind of book Jonah is, and then look at and learn from chapter one of the story together.

Jonah is one of the books in the Old Testament, grouped with what are called the Minor Prophets. And among the prophetic books Jonah is unique. Other prophetic books focus on God's words as spoken through prophets, but the book of Jonah focuses on the prophet—Jonah himself. It's probably one of the most well-known stories in the Bible, loved by adults and children. For me, I can partly identify with Jonah. But I think there are also readers who look at his character and personality and are like "What is wrong with this guy?" So what kind of person was Jonah?

Jonah was a prophet from Israel. He appears in one other passage in the OT. That's in 2 Kings 14:25, during the time of one of Israel's worst kings in history, Jeroboam II. And we learn how Jonah prophesied the favorable message that God would enlarge Jeroboam II's territory. But through another prophet Amos, God reversed all of Jonah's prophecies and announced the opposite things to Jeroboam. This put Jonah's character and credibility into question, to put it lightly. And you'll see this if you read the book of Jonah further, but Jonah is a pretty self-serving, self-centered person. But in spite of this God gives Jonah great mercy.

That is the story that we're going to be looking at starting today. It starts with God giving Jonah a certain mission. 1:1 —

Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil has come up before me.” ‭‭Jonah‬ ‭1:1-2‬ ‭‬‬

God confers on Jonah this mission—to go to the great city of Nineveh, and to tell the people there to repent.

For about 300 years this large city Nineveh had been the capital of the world-dominating Assyrian Empire. And when Assyria conquered other nations, they would commit horrible atrocities. So the surrounding peoples would submit out of fear. And Jonah is told by God to go to Nineveh to these ruthless people, his hated enemies. How do you think Jonah felt? And now he makes a bold move. Let's continue to read.

But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord. ‭‭Jonah‬ ‭1:3‬ ‭

Jonah leaves the presence of the Lord and runs away to Tarshish! Tarshish is the name of a town located in the opposite direction of Nineveh. The reason Jonah runs away is written in chapter 4, and it's because he thought that since God is gracious, compassionate, and slow to anger, if his enemies in Nineveh repented God would definitely forgive them. Jonah was angry at the God who would love, forgive, and have mercy on his enemies. It was perhaps unbearable for Jonah that his enemies in Nineveh would be saved by God. In any case, Jonah gets on a ship to run from God's command. The ship sets out, but as it crosses the sea it runs into trouble. Let's read:

But the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. ‭‭Jonah‬ ‭1:4-5‬ a

God brings a violent storm that threatens to shipwreck them. And the sailors cry out to the gods that they each believed in. They start to throw the cargo overboard so the ship wouldn't sink. But the wind doesn't let up, and neither does the danger. But what was Jonah doing?

But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep.‭‭ Jonah‬ ‭1:5‬ b

As the sailors are panicking, Jonah is sleeping! It says he was "fast asleep", so you know he was probably like making that "ZZZZ" sound. The sailors find him like this. When the captain saw him sleeping he might have been like "What are you doing!?" So he goes and wakes Jonah up.

Then with the storm raging and the ship about to sink, these sailors are like "Hey let's draw lots to figure out whose fault this is". So Including Jonah everyone on the ship draws lots. And who does it fall on? You probably already know. Jonah is the winner! And so the sailors press him for answers. Verse 8:

Then they said to him, “Tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?” And he said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, “What is this that you have done!” For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them. ‭‭Jonah‬ ‭1:8-10‬ ‭ESV‬‬

Jonah explained who he was and confesses he believes in the God Yahweh. The sailors know he is running from the Lord's presence, and so they are angry. They see the storm getting worse and worse, and ask Jonah what they should do to him so it'll calm down. Then Jonah says something unbelievable. Verse 12:

He said to them, “Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.” ‭‭Jonah‬ ‭1:12‬ ‭

Jonah says, "Throw me into the sea." To the sailors this is like saying "Kill me." However, the sailors don't immediately try this. The lives of their passengers are their highest priority, and so they desperately try to somehow get back to land. But their efforts have no effect in this stormy sea, and reluctantly they do what Jonah says.

For the first time they pray to Yahweh God, and then they throw Jonah in. And then immediately the storm stops. For them what they experienced in this moment was probably an incredible miracle. Through this affair the sailors came to know and believe in the true God. But what happened to Jonah? 1:17 —

And the Lord appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. ‭‭Jonah‬ ‭1:17‬ ‭

This is another big miracle. Jonah was probably trying to die. If he died, he wouldn't have to go to Nineveh. But God uses a big fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah spends three days and three nights inside this fish. That's the quick version of chapter 1 of the story of Jonah. If you're interested in what happens next, we're going to look at that next week, so please come to the worship service then as well.

Just from chapter 1 I think it's very clear what kind of person Jonah is. Jonah turns his back and runs from the mission God gave him. It's not the case that no other prophets who appear in the Bible had this kind of attitude, but only Jonah deliberately heads in the opposite direction to escape. And his actions also put the sailors in serious danger. We very naturally might feel like Jonah is really inconsiderate or immature.

But as we look at Jonah, can we really say we're totally different?  At times we also act in self-serving, self-centered, immature ways. We're not actually that different. Through the story of Jonah, this book shows the worst part of us. Jonah might be hiding in you as well. If you capture what Jonah was doing in one phrase, it would be "he avoided the Lord's presence". And this is the main thing we want to learn today.

Let's read 1:3 again:

But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord.‭‭ Jonah‬ ‭1:3‬

It says Jonah got up to go "from the presence of the Lord". What this means is not just separation from the Lord, God, but to run away from, turn his back on, and defy the Lord. The God we believe in we can't see with our eyes, but he really exists and is present in the world, he rules over this world now, and he works in us. This is the God Jonah was trying to run away from. In chapter 1 this phrase "from the presence of the Lord" comes up three times. And it also appears in the book of Genesis, 3:8. Let's read that:

And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. ‭‭Genesis‬ ‭3:8‬ ‭ESV‬‬

Genesis 3 describes the scene when Adam and Eve, the first humans created by God, are tempted by the devil, eat the fruit of the tree God had told them not to, and thereby bring the sinful nature into humanity and the world which had not been there before. They also hide themselves "from the presence of the Lord". They must have felt their consciences accusing them for going against God's command. And maybe they thought if they hid they wouldn't be found out. Jonah also hid himself in the lowest part of the ship when the storm was beginning. Adam, Eve, and Jonah went against God. They did self-serving, self-centered things. We also have done those kinds of things. When we sin, we hide from God. We don't want to admit our shame, so we avoid God's presence. Then before we realize it, our sin has sent us falling into a downward spiral.

Avoiding and going away from the presence of the Lord in one's thoughts, feelings, and actions are what I think is the most fundamental problem with the nature of sin. Even if we know that it's not good to live separating ourselves from God and going against him, even if we know that it is a sin, there are times we still choose it. What happens with our hearts when we make that choice? Temporarily one might have a feeling of their heart being satisfied. But after some time, our hearts are filled with guilt. And our hearts are no longer at peace.

Also sometimes we try to pass it off like, "Well I'm sinful so it happens." We try to make excuses. Other people do it so it's fine. If no one finds out it's fine, if I can hide it it's fine. Those excuses and actions are the same as what Adam, Eve, and also Jonah did when they sinned.

As long as someone is staying away from God's presence, there won't be peace or feelings of security. If we continue to separate ourselves from God, in the dark pit of sin our hearts will grow tired, our minds will grow tired, we'll weaken, and eventually we'll be destroyed.

We need to continue to seek the Lord's presence at all times. We need God. Because it's God who always graciously gives us mercy and guides us in the right direction. And if we honestly confess our sins before God, we will be freed from the dark pit of sin and granted forgiveness from God.

God revealed his presence to the ones who had gone away from him: Adam, Eve, and also Jonah. God was by their side, and he showed them mercy. And not only to Jonah, but also to the people of Nineveh who appear later in the story, and to the captain and the sailors who got caught up in Jonah's actions. Above all, God never abandoned Jonah. Actually in the book of Jonah God gives Jonah chance after chance to repent.

And God's great mercy is also given to us. God sent the Savior Jesus Christ to this earth to save us living in this present day. The last thing I would like to talk about today is that Jesus himself refers to Jonah. Matthew 12:38 —

Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.” But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭12:38-41‬ ‭ESV‬‬

Here Jesus speaks of "signs". "Sign" is used to refer to miracles such as speaking in tongues, visions, healing, prophecies, and resurrection of the dead. The reason why Jesus is talking about "signs" is that even though the scribes and Pharisees who didn't believe in Jesus saw the miracles that Jesus was doing, they were saying "If you say you're God, show us a more amazing miracle!"

In response to the scribes, after first talking about Jonah's story, Jesus states clearly that he himself is superior to Jonah. Jesus speaks about himself using the story of Jonah being in the belly of a big fish for three days and three nights. Though Jesus is God, he came to this earth as a human. Jesus died on the cross in our place for our sins. He is God, who spent three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, and on the third day rose from the dead, and he is still alive. Those who believe in Jesus Christ will be saved from sin, the Holy Spirit will dwell in them, they will be given eternal life, and in the future they will spend eternity with God. Jesus is always with us. The mission given to Jonah was, as a prophet, to lead Nineveh to repentance and save them from destruction. The mission of Jesus, who is superior to Jonah, was as the Savior to lead us all to repentance, and to not only save us from destruction but give us eternal life.

By believing in Jesus, we can always seek the face of the Lord, receive the mercy of God, separate from sin, be transformed into Christ's likeness, and walk in the right direction. Another OT book Lamentations 3:22 says, "We do not perish, for his mercies never end." God's mercy and grace are new every morning and he never stops giving. We want to be people who seek the face of the Lord not only in worship on Sundays but also in our daily lives.

I'm sure some people here aren't Christians. Thank you for participating in the service today and listening to this whole message. God has so much mercy, and he wants to have a relationship with you. And for that reason he has given Jesus Christ to us and to you. We want you to know that Jesus Christ is your Savior. To save you from sin Jesus died on the cross and was resurrected three days later. Please do learn more about this truth. Let's pray together.

Pray

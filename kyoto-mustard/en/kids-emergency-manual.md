- The evacuation site in case of a fire is in front of Fujii Daimaru (藤井大丸), and for earthquake is the Kyōto Municipal General Education Center (京都市総合教育センター). Please check where these are on a map beforehand.
- The elementary class teacher will open the emergency exit door in the case of the fire alarm ringing or an earthquake occurring, as staff will come up from the 4th floor to assist with further procedures.

**Fire**

If, during kids class, the emergency alarm rings or fire breaks out on the fifth floor, please respond as follows:

- Kids class teachers and assistants: Prioritize the evacuation of the children at all times.
- If the emergency alarm rings or a fire is discovered, begin evacuation as soon as possible.
- Evacuate one class at a time, beginning with the oldest kids.
- Use the emergency exit in the back of the building to evacuate. Due to the possibility of smoke, do not use the staircase near the elevator.

1. First, secure your evacuation route by unlocking the emergency exit, then return to calm down the children. The teacher should calm the children down and tell them to follow the teacher’s and assistant’s directions. Meanwhile, the assistant should open the classroom door, as well as one of the folding doors to the neighboring classroom.
2. The Yellow Room teacher (as of May 2021 the elementary class) will be the guide at the fire door. The teacher will calm the children down, instruct them to follow the assistant, and go to the front of the fire door. Teachers in the preschool class (and others) should calm the children down and wait until the elementary class has finished evacuating.
3. Begin evacuation with the elementary class. The elementary assistant will lead the children to Fujii Daimaru and upon arrival take attendance. They should bring the check-in sheet with them.
4. The elementary teacher will help the elementary assistant lead the kids down the fire escape stairs from their position at the emergency exit. When all elementary class children have exited the 5th floor, the teacher will go to help the preschool class.
5. The preschool teacher, preschool assistant, and elementary teacher will take all the preschool class children out the emergency exit, down the fire escape, and to Fujii Daimaru. Seth and Jared will also come to help. Upon arriving at Fujii Daimaru, take attendance and confirm all are present.

＊In emergencies, Seth is the responsible party for the 5th floor. If there is a fire or the emergency alarm rings, Seth will go to the 5th floor, call for people who are not in classrooms to evacuate via the stairs next to the elevator, and check if anyone is in the bathrooms. Following this, he will go help the preschool class.<br>＊Jared will go to the 5th floor and immediately go help the preschool class.<br>＊If the fire started on the 5th floor and seems extinguishable, Seth and Jared will attempt to put it out with the fire extinguishers.

**Earthquake**

If, during kids class, there's an earthquake, please respond as follows:

- While prioritizing first the safety of the children, open the door to the hallway and one door to the neighboring classroom and secure the evacuation route.
- The kids class teacher and assistant will to the best of their ability move the children to where they will not be struck by furniture or other objects.
- Parents will come to the 5th floor to check out and evacuate their children if there's an earthquake, so teachers and assistants will remain with the children until all the children in their class are checked out.

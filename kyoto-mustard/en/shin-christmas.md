Merry Christmas! To Christians and non-Christians alike: welcome to church. This is Shin, a staff member for this church. I'm Ben, and I'm also staff. As a church we celebrate Christmas every year. But why do Christians celebrate Christmas? For Christians, Christmas is a time to rejoice in and worship God for the coming of the Savior, and a time to share that good news.

There are many ways to worship God, like by singing or praying, but now it's time to worship through the message of the Bible. In this church, we believe that the Bible is the word of God and that through it God tells us about himself, so every week we open the Bible to learn that word. And in this (Bible) it talks about the Savior who came to where we are.

There are probably many of us for whom the word "Savior" doesn't really bring anything clearly to mind. In anime for little kids, you have Anpanman who flies to the rescue when someone is hungry or being bullied, or Ultraman who comes to save people being attacked by monsters. But thinking about the reality of life as an adult, this idea of a savior might not exactly fit with that. There are people dealing with clear difficulties, but also people who aren't. But do you ever feel like, this vague, heavy sense that something is off about the world? about our society? or even yourself?

The Bible isn't something that tries to take us out of this world of difficulties to an anime-like, unrealistic world. What the Bible clearly speaks of is this reality that a real Savior has come to this real world. This Savior is Jesus Christ.

Today, let's think about the Savior starting from the story of the shepherds who first heard about the birth of Jesus Christ.

And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. 10 And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest,   and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!” 15 When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 16 And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. 17 And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. 18 And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them…20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

The first people in the world to get the happy news that Jesus Christ was born were shepherds. (Luke 8: 1 Slide) <br><br>When you hear the word shepherd, you might imagine happy people hanging out with sheep. And if you look way back through Israel's history, actually shepherds were respected from the start. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the ancestors of Israel, all took care of sheep, and Moses who brought Israel out of Egypt also had experience as a shepherd. David, who is said to be the greatest king in Israel's history, was also a shepherd when he was a child.

But as settlements became more permanent and the economy centered more on agriculture and commerce, shepherds were increasingly looked down on. They spent a lot of their time on the plains away from the city with the sheep. So people living in the city didn't have a deep familiarity or connection with shepherds. That's why it's thought that normal people's impression of shepherds at that time was that they were rough, somewhat unreliable people.

So again these shepherds are distanced from the city where people live and they're camping out in the fields, watching their sheep at night. No one was thinking about them, so separated from city life. And their work wasn't easy. Every day from morning until night, they're taking care of lots of sheep, leading them to where they can eat, and sometimes fighting wild animals to protect them.

Of course, that's not to say their lives were constant suffering. Probably there were fun times as well as hard times. I imagine they also had good times together, or looked up in wonder at a night sky full of stars.

And our lives are similar, aren't they. There are really hard times, and there are good times. And so you might be living feeling like, _well, I guess that's just the way it is_.

But why is this what life is in the first place? The Bible teaches that in the beginning God created the whole world.

 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

This pure and good God at the start made a good world. And so in this world there is joy, fun, beauty, and justice. And we have the heart to seek it. And we have a desire for those things.

But at the same time, the world is full of things in opposition to God's goodness. Sadness, suffering, destruction, injustice. How did this get into the good world God created? In a book called Genesis in the Bible, God gave every good thing to the first humans Adam and Eve, and told them to not eat the fruit of only one tree. But they go ahead and eat that fruit. They act against what God had said. As a result, the relationship between humans and God breaks, and evil enters the world. And so humanity, having refused to obey God, begins to seek something else to put at the center of their lives. It could be the self, personal values, an admired person, or various other things that people try to put at the center, but they're all something other than God. But this (putting something other than God at the center) creates problems. Because what I'm putting at the center of my life and what you're putting at the center of your life are different. And as a result, values can collide and people clash with each other. The Bible calls this disobeying God "sin".

Now we still are permitted to live in this world that God created. However, we live having rejected God, burdened with sin and suffering from sin's effects. That is why the joy of this world always has a shadow of sadness. No matter how many fun times you have, at some point it ends. No matter how well you lived, the time comes when we die.

And in this balance between good things and bad things, I think there are probably many people who live their lives so that there are even just a few more good things than bad.

I think the shepherds, like us, lived with this conflict that everyone experiences. But they come across a joy that will completely change their lives.

9 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. 10 And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.”

An angel from God comes to the shepherds and reports a message of joy. "For unto you is born a Savior." In other words, the one who will restore the broken relationship between God and us humans and fix the broken parts of this world has come. And the angel of the Lord calls this Savior "Christ the Lord". Jesus is often called Jesus Christ, but Christ is not actually Jesus' surname. Christ (or Christos) is a Greek word for God's chosen one, the one God promised to send to save the world.

And in this word "Lord" the reason why Jesus can save the world is concealed. This same word "Lord" has been used 19 times from the beginning of the gospel of Luke until this point. And each time, it meant the one God, the Creator of the world. The same word is used here to refer to the newborn Savior. What does this mean? That God Himself, the Lord and Creator of all, had become a human, born into this world as a baby—the person Jesus.

Because of sin we pushed God out of the center of our lives, and as a result we don't know what to center on anymore. We're like a sheep wandering around on its own. However, God came to guide us like a shepherd, to once again become our Lord and the center of our lives.

But it wasn't just as a leader to guide us to do the right things. As an adult, Jesus likens himself to a shepherd and says this:

John 10:10-11 I came that [the sheep] may have life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

Jesus became human and came to this world to lay down his life for us, who were wandering like sheep. In order for us who had gone against God to return to God, our sins must first be resolved. The result of sin is our destruction, ultimately death. And that is a physical death, but also a spiritual death, being forever separated from God. But God still loved us even though we had rebelled against him, and sent Jesus to save us. This is the point of God the Creator becoming a human. As the Savior, Jesus died in our place, on the cross. On the cross, God's judgment on human sin was poured on Jesus.

And then Jesus having settled the problem of our sin by his death on the cross, God raises him back to life. There are several pieces of evidence which support the resurrection of Jesus being a real historical event. The resurrected Jesus is the Savior who saves us from sin and the Lord who we should follow as the center of our lives.

God has already done this wonderful thing for us and is now giving us the opportunity to believe it. Let's go back to the shepherds' story and see how we can respond to this good news.

1. First, the good news that the Savior had arrived was first reported to the shepherds. As I mentioned earlier, the shepherds lived away from the city and people didn't often associate with them. However, God hadn't forgotten about them and tells them first the news of this joy. When God has a party, the first people he invites isn't the king, powerful people, rich people—it's shepherds. At some point you also may have felt that you don't have a place in society or that your existence is not very important. However, it's to you that God is now giving the good news that this Savior has come.

2. The Savior calls you to believe from unexpected places. After telling the shepherds that the Savior, the Lord Christ, was born, the angel of the Lord continues like this:

12 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.

Since there wasn't any other place for the newborn Jesus, he was laid in a manger, where animals eat from. When you think of God, the Creator of the world, coming to earth, would anyone imagine a baby sleeping in a manger? Far different from the power, wealth, and luxury we would normally imagine, the Savior of the world was a little baby laid down to sleep. That was a surprising thing, but the shepherds believe and they set out.

15 When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 16 And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. 17 And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. 18 And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them.20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

And when they head out, they find that what the angel said had happened. As we search for things that will fill our lives, we might not typically think that an answer can be found in church or the Bible. And it is honestly speaking surprising that the Jesus who shed his blood and died on the cross is our only savior, just as it is a surprise that the baby laid down to sleep in the manger is God. But the shepherds believed God's word. They saw the Savior clearly with their own eyes. And that story has been passed down to us now thousands of years later. God's message that the Savior has come is also being told to us.

The shepherds who believed in God's Word returned, glorifying and praising God, because it was all true.

The world is still suffering from the effects of sin. However, through Jesus restoration has begun. When we believe in Jesus, we also join in that restoration. As we live life following Jesus, little by little the broken parts of us begin to heal. Like when you find joy and hope in how amazing God is. Or when you find you've been given the desire to show love to someone that to this point you could only hate. If you are a Christian, you probably have experiences of restoration like this, and each time overflows in praise to God. But it's still a partial restoration. The Bible promises that one day Jesus will return to this world, and that's when everything in the world will be restored. Jesus, who rose from death, *will* come to fully accomplish the saving of the world. And those who believe in Jesus and follow him as Christ the Lord will glorify and praise God.

Jesus, the Savior, has already come to this world, has been crucified for our sins, and has been raised. And this good news of joy is still being shared with each of us here. The Savior has come. Believe in Jesus and receive this good news this Christmas.

Pray

It's time for Communion. Communion is a time for Christians who have been baptized, believing in the happy news that Jesus is the Savior and Lord. The fact that Jesus died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected does not mean that once we believe and are saved, that's it. Christians are those who have been and are still being changed by the death and resurrection of Jesus. That is why, in obedience to Jesus' words, we have Communion, in order to focus on the cross and the resurrection. Bread represents the body of Christ, and grape juice represents the blood of Christ. By eating and drinking it, we remember the joy that Jesus died for our sins and rose from the dead.

Because of this meaning, it's something Christians who believe and have been baptized receive. If you're not a Christian yet, think about Jesus Christ at your own seat this time. If anyone wants to know or believe in this Savior, that's so good. Please talk to the church staff or other Christians around you after worship.

If you are a Christian, after praying, please come to the table in front of you, return to your seat, and take it whenever you like.

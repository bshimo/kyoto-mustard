Matthew 6:5

We're going to look at the Bible together now. At this church we learn from the Bible every week because through it the God who really exists speaks to us in words we can understand. Currently we're learning about Jesus' life from the gospel according to Matthew, which is part of the Bible. Jesus the Son of God lowered himself and came as an Israelite in first century Palestine. Israel at the time was controlled by the Roman Empire.

It was to these people under the control of a foreign nation that Jesus shared the good news that the kingdom of heaven had come near, and they began to gather around him. Who could you find in these people? There were chronically ill people who had suffered for 10 years or more. There were parents whose children had been assaulted by Roman soldiers. Many people were just scraping by, struggling under the Roman Empire's heavy taxes. Some were unable to pay and had family members stolen and sold as slaves. And because of taxes being taken not just by Rome but also by Israelite rulers, many people were in debt to their fellow Israelites. Some of those who came to Jesus had their land stolen as a result of this debt, and no matter how much they worked, their efforts would only enrich the wealthy. And so many of those who gathered around Jesus were in pain and feeling the injustice of a broken world.

On the other hand, around Jesus there were also a lot of tax collectors who had lined their own pockets by levying large taxes on behalf of the Roman Empire. And there were others who were simply affluent, having fun and living life without much concern for the suffering around them. It's to all these people Jesus says this:

**Matthew 5:6**  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

Jesus says here that people who hunger and thirst for righteousness are actually blessed or happy, but what is he talking about?

The word **righteousness** comes up seven times in Matthew's gospel. Five of those times are in the Sermon on the Mount we're reading now. Matthew uses righteousness broadly to mean that things go the way God plans or wants them to go.

This is important so we keep saying it every week, but there are two main ideas to keep in mind to understand the Sermon on the Mount. Those are **the Kingdom and Disciples**. And to understand this word righteousness here that context is important. In this same sermon Jesus says this:

**Matthew 6:33**  But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.

And he also taught us to pray like this:

**Matthew 6:10** Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

To hunger and thirst for righteousness is to want God's kingdom to come and his will to happen on the earth the way it does in heaven. And the word righteousness is being used here to say that God's kingdom and God's will doesn't refer to just a spiritual salvation. It includes us being changed into just people and being made into people who join the work of actualizing the just world God designed.

Jesus is saying these things to people who became his disciples. So why do his disciples, in other words Christians, become hungry and thirsty for righteousness? There are two reasons.

**1. Jesus' disciples hunger and thirst for righteousness because they know how amazing God's design is.**

God is the one who created everything in this world. Everything you can see and everything you can't see. And in the Bible it says when God created everything, he said that it wasn't just good but "very good". God is powerful and creative and so he made this world a truly beautiful place. Not just the Earth, but the Milky Way, and the stars we've never seen at the edge of space. He made not just a few colors but all hues. Different seasons, various flowers and plants, all kinds of animals, fish, and birds—He made all of them beautiful. And as the climactic act of creation God made humans in His image. Human beings are not God, but were created as beings which reflect God like a mirror. We were created to accept God's love and to love, care for, respect, and help each other. And we were made to enjoy God's amazing world, to reflect God's creativity, and to come up with various cultures that all worship God.

But why is it that this amazing world God made sounds like a fairy tale or a utopian dream? That's because the world we live in is so different.

**2. Jesus' disciples hunger and thirst for righteousness because they know the weight of the sin which destroys God's design**

The amazing world God made became this current world of pain because of human sin. Sin is all the things we do, say, and feel that go against God's design. It's like a disease that is destroying people from the utter inside out. This is why even though God made many peoples and cultures to show the diversity of his design and for each one to reflect his image, we use those differences to discriminate against others. Men and women were made to love, respect, and help each other, but instead because of sin those relationships have power plays, violence, and sexual exploitation.

When we see the reality of God's design being broken, the reality that things are tainted by sin, and when we experience that suffering, our hearts are shouting that it's not supposed to be like this, this isn't right. This is what hungering and thirsting for righteousness is.

All of us in this broken world are suffering, wounded by sin. But at the same time sin is also in our own hearts. Our hearts which were made to love people are jealous, hateful, and angry because of sin. Even if God give us a lot, instead of sharing with others, we think about what's most advantageous for ourselves. If you take a hard look at your own heart, you will find that the same sin that breaks God's design and creates all the problems in this world is also in you.

But God isn't just going to let things things keep being the way they are. The Bible promises that Jesus will one day return to this world, at which time it will be remade and God's righteous kingdom will come to completion.

**2 Peter 3:12-13** …the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

At that time, our world will be a new place of righteousness. All evil is destroyed by God's righteousness, and God's design is revived. We have a desire for such a world. But at the same time we are guilty and far from righteousness. Is there a place for us in the kingdom of God where righteousness lives? I have good news. The greatness of God's plan is not only to destroy sin, but also to save and change sinful people and make them suitable for living in the new heavens and earth where righteousness dwells. And this is <em>grace</em> that is given to those who believe in Jesus and become disciples.

Jesus was hungry and thirsty for righteousness more than anyone else. And the reason that he as the Son of God came to this world wasn't just to teach amazing things. It was to bring the kingdom of God to this world broken by sin. And for this purpose Jesus was crucified and took all of our sin on himself. The death of Jesus on the cross took away the sins of all who believe in him. And God resurrected Jesus from death. Now, anyone who repent of their sins and believes in Jesus will, just as Jesus died and was resurrected, die with respect to sin and obtain new life as a resident of God's righteousness-filled kingdom. After Jesus rose from the dead he returned to heaven, and when he comes back to this earth someday, he will establish a perfected world where righteousness dwells.

But until then, the task of spreading the kingdom of God in this world tainted by sin is left to Jesus' disciples who hunger and thirst for righteousness. When we became disciples of Jesus, we were given the privilege of participating in this work of his. As disciples of Jesus, we hunger and thirst for righteousness when we see our own wrong behavior or when we see evil prevailing in the society around us. And like Jesus, who sacrificed himself to bring the kingdom of God's righteousness here, we participate in his work by making sacrifices ourselves to spread God's righteousness in this world. And God will satisfy our hunger and thirst.

In this world sin is everywhere, and so God's righteousness is needed everywhere. That is why we too can pursue and work for righteousness in many places. Working in schools, including those for students who have special educational needs, serving and loving children is a great way to work for the sake of righteousness. In business, creating a humane workplace and serving those in our society who are in a weaker position can also be a great thing to work at. However, those who are hungry for righteousness are.. well, hungry, so they actively seek righteousness and go out to places where the kingdom of God has not yet arrived. Just as Jesus left heaven and came to this world, we also leave behind what's comfortable for us and go. There are many unrecognized things which are unjust or unrighteous in our lives and in the society around us. But every time a person who hungers and thirsts for righteousness encounters a new injustice, they experience pain, they repent, and they seek God's righteousness. And each time they do, God's kingdom grows.

Today, as a concrete step toward that end, we have the privilege of hearing from Yuri Osborne of Zoe Japan. Zoe Japan is an organization working to combat one of the major injustices in society today—human trafficking. For the rest of our message time, I would like to hear your thoughts.

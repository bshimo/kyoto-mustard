Q1. Do you know how much God loves everyone? <br>Q2. Do you believe that God forgives the bad things everyone who apologizes from their heart has done?

1. Today we're talking about the story of Jonah. A long time ago, there was a big city called Nineveh.
2. It was so big it took three days to go from one end to the other. The people who lived there were doing a lot of bad things.
3. God told the prophet Jonah to go to Nineveh and tell them about God's salvation. That was because God was planning to destroy the people living there who were doing all those bad things.
4. But Jonah knew how bad those people in Nineveh were, so he headed toward a town in the totally opposite direction of where God had commanded him to go.
5. Jonah got on a ship and ran away from God. God caused a big storm, and people were scared to death and prayed for their gods to save them. Jonah knew the storm was God's anger, and it was his fault because he didn't obey God.
6. The people on the ship didn't know whose fault it was, so they drew lots. At the time it seems God would answer people through drawing lots.
7. The lot singled out Jonah, and he told them if they threw him in the sea, it would calm down. So even though they were afraid, they threw him in. And the storm stopped and became calm.
8. What do you think happened to Jonah in the sea? God sent a big fish to Jonah, made it swallow him, and he was in the fish's belly for three days and three nights.
9. Jonah prayed to God from the belly of the fish. Then the fish vomited Jonah out. After being vomited out, where do you think Jonah went?
10. He went to the place where the people he hated lived, the city of Nineveh, to tell them about God's salvation and love.
11. Here's what he said: "In forty days Nineveh will be demolished!" He kept saying just this phrase. And then a lot of people believed in God. Even the king followed God, and God's salvation spread, so instead of God destroying the people in Nineveh, they were saved.
12. This is a true story. But even though Jonah had this amazing experience, he complained to God. You and I also are like this sometimes.
13. God always loves us humans and graciously goes to save them. About 2000 years ago, Jesus graciously came to this earth to save us. After being crucified, he was buried in a tomb for three days and then rose from the dead.
14. Jesus is *actually* God. And it is actually so great to believe in Jesus and follow him. Do you know what I mean?
15. I know this really well for myself. It's because I've experienced God's love and his help a lot. Last week God graciously helped me and I experienced a lot of joy.
16. I think you're here at worship today because your dad or your mom believe in Jesus.
17. Here's a super important question. Do you believe in Jesus from your heart? Do you know that God really loves us, and do you believe that?
18. If you believe in Jesus, then try talking about Jesus' love and salvation to your friends or others who haven't come to believe in Jesus yet. If you feel like that's too hard, or you're embarrassed or scared, and you can't, then when you pray, please pray for those friends or family to believe in Jesus and be saved.

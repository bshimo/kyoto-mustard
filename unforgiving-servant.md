Have you ever done a job before, like a chore? Maybe for your parents or grandparents? How much did you get paid?

What if I got a job at a convenience store (draw the inside of a convenience store and a person working) and worked 8 hours a day for 900 yen/hour? How much money do I make in a day? How about in 100 days?

That’s right, 72万円。That’s a lot of money. What should I spend it on? (House, food, etc.) Would you save any? I think I would try to save some money.

Ok so at the convenience store I have some coworkers. Let’s draw one. Boy or girl?

Now imagine my coworker at the convenience store says to me, “Hey I’m really sorry to ask, but I need to borrow some money.” And I say “Ok, how much?” And s/he (pick one) says “Like 72万円”. I say WOW that’s a lot of money. Would you lend him that much money?

Well I decide to lend him the money. 100 days of work! But I think he’ll pay me back. Plus he’ll probably be really thankful right. 

Some time goes by and now I work for the company head office. Let’s draw the head office. I feel pretty good. But then one day I make a mistake at work. So I open a spreadsheet and see how bad it is. Maybe I can fix it. I calculate how much money my mistake costs and…

OH NO. My mistake is so bad it costs the company all the money they made the whole year. Wait, two times the whole year of income. It’s more than 4000億円 (like 4 billion dollars). All the blood goes out of my head. I feel sick. Then I get a phone call. I pick up the phone. It’s a secretary. “The owner wants you in his office now.”

I go to the office. What do you think is going to happen to me? I’ll definitely be fired. Maybe something worse.

So as soon as I enter the office I do dogeza and say “Please just wait, and I’ll pay you back everything!!” I don’t know what I’m saying. Is there any way I could ever pay back that money? (NO!) Actually because of interest my debt would keep getting bigger, not smaller.

Then the owner says something crazy. He says, “You know what? _____, I forgive you. You don’t owe me anything. And I want you to keep working for me.”

How do I feel? (shocked, thankful, etc.)

I walk out of the office feeling great. But that reminds me, a few years ago I let my coworker borrow like 72万円。So I call him/her up and I say, 

“PAY ME ALL MY MONEY!! I’M GOING TO GET A LAWYER AND YOU’RE GOING TO GO TO JAIL IF YOU DON’T PAY ME!!!” And I say more mean things to them, and then I hang up and message all our mutual friends at work about how they never paid me back. 

Isn’t that so terrible? Well Jesus said if we think we’ve been forgiven by God but we don’t forgive others, we’re just like this. In his story, there’s no convenience store, but there is a master and servants. Jesus said, “When the other servants saw what had taken place (where the servant who was forgiven didn’t forgive the other servant), they were deeply distressed and went and reported to their master everything that had happened. Then, after he had summoned him, his master said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?’ And because he was angry, his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he could pay everything that was owed. So also my heavenly Father will do to you unless every one of you forgives his brother or sister from your heart.”

Sometimes people do wrong things to us. And technically they should pay us back or else be punished. But actually we need to pay back God even more. Maybe you don’t feel like it right now, but each person in the world has sinned and needs to pay God back to fix their mistakes. But the cost of sin is too much and no one can pay God back, so we all deserve to be punished forever. But if we trust in Jesus and become his disciples, God forgives our debts and doesn’t punish us at all. And he isn’t angry at us but loves us instead. Why? (Because Jesus pays our debt for us.) How did he do that? (By dying on the cross.)

So if I’m 100% forgiven by God and someone does something bad to me, should I hold a grudge? Should I try to do something back to them? What if they deserve it? No, I should forgive them because God has forgiven me of so much more.
